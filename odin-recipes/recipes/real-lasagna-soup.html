      Real Lasagna Soup
    </h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        This incredible lasagna soup tastes exactly like a really good lasagna, <br>
        but is a very rich, very meaty tomato soup. The little bit of extra work <br>
        you'll do precooking the noodles, then baking them in the oven is absolutely<br>
        worth the time and effort. The buttery, baked, and toasted noodles that are <br>
        then added to the soup make this absolutely phenomenal.<br>

      Directions
    </h2>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in lasagna<br>
          noodles and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until just flexible,<br>
          4 to 5 minutes. Transfer noodles into cold water until cooled; drain very well.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and grease<br>
           parchment with 1 tablespoon olive oil.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Cut noodles in half lengthwise. Arrange noodles in evenly overlapping rows on the prepared baking sheet.<br>
           Brush with melted butter, and use fingers to rub some butter between the noodles.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake noodles in the preheated oven until they are golden, blistered, and are beginning to brown with crispy<br>
           outside edges. Let cool; cut into bite-sized pieces.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to a soup pot, and place over high heat. Add beef and sausage. Use a spatula to<br>
           break up the meat into small pieces; cook without stirring until liquid evaporates and meat begins to sizzle<br>
            in its own fat, then continue to cook and stir until meat begins to brown, about 7 minutes.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Add onions, garlic, tomato paste, red pepper flakes, dried oregano, black pepper, and kosher salt. Cook and<br>
           stir until onions begin to turn translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in chicken broth, tomato sauce, and water. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium low, and simmer for<br>
           45 minutes.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          In a bowl, stir ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese together; set aside.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Increase the heat under soup to medium high; stir in noodle pieces. Cook, stirring, until pasta is tender, <br>
          about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and stir in the 2 tablespoons Italian parsley.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve in bowls with a scoop of cheese mixture, and sprinkle with freshly torn basil and Italian parsley if 
          desired.<br><br>
        </li>
