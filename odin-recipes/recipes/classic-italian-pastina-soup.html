      <ol>
        <p>
          <li>
            Place chicken in a large pot and pour water over to cover.
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>
            Roughly chop 2 stalks of celery, 1 1/2 onions, and 2 carrots and add to pot with chicken.<br>
            Season with 2 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper and bring pot to a boil over high heat. <br>
            Reduce the heat to medium-low and allow the chicken to simmer 1 hour, covered.<br>
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>
            Remove chicken from the pot and allow to cool before removing and shredding the meat. <br>
            Strain the stock and discard the solids. Reserve liquid and add water if necessary to <br>
            measure 12 cups of liquid.  Wipe pot clean.<br>
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>
            Finely chop remaining celery, onion and carrot. Place pot over medium-high heat and add oil.<br>
            Add chopped vegetables, remaining salt, pepper and garlic and cook frequently until vegetables <br>
            are tender and onion is translucent (the veggies should not be browned). Add reserved stock and <br>
            chicken base and stir to combine. Bring mixture to a boil and reduce it to simmer. <br>
            Allow soup to simmer 10 minutes.
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>
            Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Add pasta and cook, stirring occasionally 15 minutes or<br>
            until pasta is tender. Reduce heat to low and add chicken and season if desired. Cook 5 additional <br>
            minutes. Stir in chopped parsley and serve with grated Parmesan cheese.<br>
