      Real Italian Calzones
    </h1>
    <p>
      These calzones are the real deal because there is no tomato sauce inside! <br>
      We eat them at least once a week. Have a bowl of tomato or spaghetti sauce <br>
      on the table for people to top their calzone if desired. <br>

      Directions
    </h2>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Make dough: Dissolve yeast in warm water in a mixing<br>
          bowl; let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon <br>
          oil, sugar, and salt; mix in 1 cup flour until smooth. Gradually <br>
          stir in remaining flour until dough is smooth and workable.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough until<br> 
          it is elastic, about 5 minutes. Place 1 teaspoon olive oil in a <br>
          large bowl; lay dough in the bowl and flip to coat with oil. Cover <br>
          and let rise until almost doubled in size, about 40 minutes.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, make the filling: Combine Cheddar cheese, ricotta cheese,<br> 
          pepperoni, mushrooms, and basil leaves in a medium bowl. Mix well, <br>
          cover, and refrigerate to chill.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Punch down dough; divide into 2 equal pieces. Roll each piece out on <br>
          a lightly floured surface into 1/8-inch-thick circles. Fill each circle <br>
          with 1/2 of the cheese and meat filling.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Fold dough over filling to make a semicircle. Press edges down with <br>
          the tines of a fork to seal. Brush the top of each calzone with beaten <br>
          egg and place on the prepared baking sheet.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve hot.<br>
